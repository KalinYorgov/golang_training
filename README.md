# golang_training

I'm trying to learn GO (for fun, for personal project and also for maybe applying and getting a job if I find it interesting and something I want to do) <br>
        p.s. For now I do find it interesting... <br>
I'm learing from youtube from Derek Banas video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzLrWHZa-Kc&t=5s <br>
